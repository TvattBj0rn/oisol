## Planned features

The features below are not ordered by priority. These are just ideas that I might add later on the future, even though some are more likely than other.

- An implementation of the Foxhole War API to discord, allowing to target specifics regions and get more infos. (Currently working on it, on another repository)
- Better logi integration with google sheet & picture recognition
- A return of the foxhole wiki integration, this time with all pages containing info boxes
